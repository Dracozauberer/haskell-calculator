# Haskell Calculator

🧮 Mathematical expression calculator and parser built in Haskell

## About

This is a learning project to demonstrate functional programming concepts in Haskell, including:
- Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)
- Pattern matching
- Recursion
- Parsing
- Pure functions

The calculator can evaluate mathematical expressions like `2 + 3 * (4 - 1)` with proper operator precedence.

## Status

🚧 **Work in Progress** - Currently setting up the project structure.

## Planned Features

- [x] Project setup
- [ ] Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- [ ] Parentheses support
- [ ] Expression parser
- [ ] Interactive CLI
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Documentation

## Requirements

- GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)
- Stack (Haskell build tool)
- Windows: MSYS2 toolchain

## Installation
